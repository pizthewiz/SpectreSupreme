### NOTES
* resource is rendered as a one-shot, continuous rendering is not offered but could be simulated through periodically changeing the URL with an anchor or parameter

### THANKS
* Tamas Nagy (À?À?) and Anton Marini (vade) for the inspiration and point of reference through [CoGeWebKit](http://code.google.com/p/cogewebkit/)
